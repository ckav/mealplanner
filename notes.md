ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, we can dive right into that idea. And just to note, I’ll keep everything in UK English spelling for you. So feel free to tell me more about the app concept you have in mind, and we’ll get started.

You said:
The idea is that HelloFresh and Gusto and others
ChatGPT said:
Are you thinking about HelloFresh and Gousto in terms of competitors, or do you want to explore a similar subscription/meal kit model for your own idea? If you give me a bit more detail on what angle you’re looking at — for example, customer experience, pricing, differentiation, or a new service concept — I can expand it into something structured for you.

You said:
The idea is that I have a like HelloFresh app experience. So I can choose recipe cards and have items, you know, single portion or double portion. We've got meals for dinner, meals for lunch. So I can do the kind of prep and then have all the items delivered in, you know, like a Tesco's delivery. So I can paste the items into a, you know, Sainsbury's or a powder or whatever. You know, it's reduced waste. It's also helping me to, you know, eat better. I'm able to do portion control. If there was some, yeah, so the inspiration or the important part is to kind of help me diversify the things I'm cooking. And then there's got that kind of HelloFresh experience. So it's like, you know, it's fast, you know, you're cooking under 20 minutes with, you know, low fat or whatever. To help me, you know, cook for one person or you'd be able to, if you had a family, you'd be able to say, well, there's five people or a trial or whatever. And then have that list to be able to be populated. And then if it was, you know, if I had dietary requirements or if I had a goal, it'd be helping me achieve that. You know, less waste. The HelloFresh is often, you know, give me the, forget an item and it ruins the meal. Or the, you know, the vegetables or whatever are all passed, you know, used by date within a couple of days. So when it's, you know, some person trying to make three meals across an entire week, yeah, they're used by date and things. It's often, you know, you sort of feel panicked because you need to, you might buy, you know, cook things straight away. And then because HelloFresh, they now do, you know, one portion. It's really expensive. And it's a simple personal, you know, to make it economical, is buying four meals to last me over maybe eight or nine days. And I'm having that same meal, essentially, as three portions. So two plains, and I'm putting in jokes for lunch, I think. Yeah, so I like to explore a way to help me diversify and to bring a bit more enjoyment back into cooking. And what I like about HelloFresh is it does have those recipe cards. I think you can do that via the app, and sort of follow along cooking.
ChatGPT said:
Got it — you’re essentially describing a “HelloFresh-style experience without the HelloFresh box”, where the app gives you the choice, structure, and fun of recipe cards, but the actual food sourcing is left flexible (Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Ocado etc.). Let me break this down into something more structured for you:

Core Concept
An app that combines meal kit curation with flexible grocery delivery integration.

Recipe-first experience: You browse meal cards (dinner, lunch, snacks) with cooking time, portion control, calorie/nutrition filters, and dietary preferences.

Dynamic shopping list builder: Selected recipes auto-populate into a list that can be exported directly into Tesco/Sainsbury’s/Ocado.

Waste reduction: Items are portion-sized for one person, a couple, or a family. Ingredients not fully used in one recipe are smartly re-used in another (e.g. buy one pack of coriander, use across two meals).

Health and goals focus: Options to filter by “under 20 minutes”, “low fat”, “high protein”, “vegetarian”, etc.

Smoother shelf-life management: Recipes are suggested based on ingredient life spans (e.g. use fresh spinach early, cupboard staples later).

Problems It Solves
Cost and waste

HelloFresh portions are expensive for single users.

Excess ingredients often go off before being used.

Your idea lets you buy in supermarket pack sizes and use them efficiently.

Flexibility

No locked subscription box.

Swap ingredients if you already have them at home.

Integrate recipes into your usual grocery shop.

Enjoyment and variety

Keeps cooking fun with a rotating set of cards.

Helps people try new flavours without committing to a whole week of the same meal.

Dietary and lifestyle alignment

Recipe filters by goals (portion control, calories, macros).

Aligns cooking habits with long-term goals (e.g. “three quick dinners + two batch-cook lunches + one treat meal”).

Key Features
Recipe discovery: Search by mood (“quick dinner”, “something comforting”), or by health goal.

Portion flexibility: 1, 2, 4, or 5+ servings — automatically scales ingredient amounts.

Shopping integration: “Send to Tesco basket” (or whichever supermarket).

Smart meal planner: Suggests a week’s worth of meals balanced for nutrition, budget, and ingredient reuse.

Digital recipe cards: Step-by-step instructions with photos/videos, optimised for mobile (like HelloFresh cards, but interactive).

Pantry sync: Tick off what’s already at home to reduce over-buying.

Expiry-aware planning: Tracks best-before dates and nudges you to use short-life ingredients first.

Differentiation from HelloFresh
No pre-boxed delivery — avoids high costs and subscription lock-in.

Personal shopping flexibility — you buy from your preferred store.

Economical single portions — not forcing “family-size packs” unless you choose.

Smarter sustainability — less packaging, less food waste.

Possible Business Models
Freemium app: Free basic recipes, premium subscription for tailored meal plans and integrations.

Affiliate grocery model: Revenue share when items are added to Tesco/Ocado baskets via the app.

Community/marketplace: Allow chefs and nutritionists to upload recipe packs (monetised like an app store).

Do you want me to sketch this into a visual user flow/wireframe (like how the app might look: recipe browse → select → generate list → push to Tesco)? That would help translate your idea from concept into something you could show as a prototype.

You said:
“I would like some help with ideation, so I think one, firstly, is to solve a problem for myself. How does recipe collection work?”
00:15
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, let’s dive into that. So if you’re thinking about how the recipe collection piece works, we can break it down into a few simple layers of ideation.

First off, imagine you have a digital library or a sort of curated collection of recipes. This might be a mix of your favourites, popular picks, or even user-generated recipes if you want to expand it later. The key is that you’re giving people a way to browse and select recipes just like they would in a meal kit app—except now they have the freedom to drop those ingredients into their supermarket basket.

In terms of how that collection works for you personally, it can be as simple as starting with a small base of recipes you already like and then adding in new ones that meet your needs over time. You might categorise them by how quick they are to cook, what kind of dietary goals they match, or even how well they use up the ingredients you have on hand.

So really, the ideation step is about thinking of the app as your personal recipe collection that helps you eat better and waste less. And from there, we can figure out how to make it as convenient and flexible as possible.

You said:
“OK, so in terms of creating an app, I mean, I don't necessarily need to have it as an iPhone app or an Android app or whatever. Maybe even a simple web app would be fine.”
00:17
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, starting

ChatGPT said:
So we'll just keep it nice and simple and purely exploratory for now. I think that's a great approach. You can absolutely start with just a little web app—just something that works in a browser and lets you test out how you like collecting recipes, building your grocery lists, and all that fun stuff. Once you’ve played around with it for yourself, you can always expand later if you want to.

You said:
“Copyright on recipes work, so if I was to find a recipe online, perhaps I wanted to use an image of that recipe, so it's a visual aid. How does the republishing or repurposing a recipe, how does that work?”
00:20
ChatGPT said:
Sure! So, in a nutshell, recipes themselves—meaning just the list of ingredients and basic instructions—aren't usually protected by copyright. What is protected, though, is the creative expression, like the unique wording, the storytelling around the recipe, and definitely the photos that someone took.

So if you find a recipe online and you want to reuse the image, you do need to be mindful of that. Using someone else’s photo without permission can be a copyright issue. A good workaround is to either use royalty-free images or take your own photos if you’re cooking the recipe yourself.

In terms of republishing or repurposing, it’s totally fine to take inspiration from recipes, but if you’re using someone else’s exact text or images, you’d want to get permission or give proper credit. Since this is just a personal exploration for now, you can definitely start with your own content or freely available images just to keep things simple.

You said:
“So if I was to use somebody's image, so in order to get this up and running, would I be able to kind of just put a note to say source of, you know, with a click through to their original recipe?”
00:19
ChatGPT said:
Yes, exactly. Giving credit and including a link back to the original source is a good way to handle it if you want to use someone else’s image. It’s not a guaranteed legal permission, but many recipe creators are happy as long as you give them proper attribution. It's kind of like a courtesy and a nod to their work.

In other words, if you include a note like "Image source: [Website Name]" with a clickable link, that usually shows that you’re acknowledging the original creator. And if you ever do want to be extra sure, you can always reach out to the owner and just ask for permission. But for a personal exploratory project, credit and a link back is a pretty good step.

You said:
“So let's work out what's the minimum viable product, what that might look like.”
00:06
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, let's sketch out that MVP. So for a minimum viable product, we can keep things really lean and straightforward. Think of it as a simple web app that does just a few core things to get you started.

1. Basic Recipe Library:
We'll begin with a small set of recipes—maybe just a handful that you like or find online. You can manually add them for now, and each recipe will have a title, ingredient list, instructions, and ideally an image with a source link if you're using someone else’s photo.

2. Recipe Selection and Portion Control:
You’ll be able to choose a recipe and set the number of portions—like cooking for one, two, or four people. The app can then adjust the ingredient quantities accordingly.

3. Grocery List Generation:
Once you pick a recipe and set the portions, the app can generate a simple shopping list. This is just a list of ingredients that you can either copy-paste into your supermarket’s online shopping cart or just use as a reference.

4. Simple Web Interface:
The MVP can be a basic web app that you can access from your browser. It doesn’t need to be fancy—just a clean, minimal layout where you can browse recipes, select portions, and generate your shopping list.

This way, you’ve got the bare essentials to test out the concept and see how it feels for you. You can always add more features later, but this MVP will let you explore the idea without any big complexity.

You said:
“Okay, so I don't have any coding skills, well, minimum coding skills, so I could do some of this myself. I'm thinking something like Airtable would be, or Excel spreadsheet or something might be a good start. So if I've got the list of ingredients, it's basically in a database and it's sort of storing the image, the source.”
00:27
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, that’s a

You said:
“I need, I think the bit that is getting a bit maybe complicated, I think possibly AI would be able to help me. So something like portion control. So if I had a recipe that I liked, let's say it's an Asian stir-fry or something, and it's for four people, just dividing everything by four doesn't quite work all the time because it still needs to be, you know, the liquid amounts, you know, it doesn't quite work. So how can I kind of get around making it a bit more foolproof?”
00:40
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, that makes sense. Portion scaling can get a little tricky, especially when you're dealing with things like sauces, spices, or just those little nuances that don’t scale evenly. Using something like Airtable is actually a great idea as a starting point because you can have your ingredient list stored in a nice, organised way. And if you want to add a little AI magic on top of that, you could have a simple script or a small bit of automation that helps you adjust the proportions more intelligently.

For example, you can have a rule of thumb for certain ingredients. Maybe liquids scale differently from solids, or spices have a minimum amount so the flavour isn’t lost. You can set up a little logic so that when you change the portion size, it’s not just dividing everything by the same number, but applying some smart adjustments.

And the good news is you don’t have to code all of that from scratch. There are definitely no-code tools or even simple AI helpers that can do that tweaking for you. So, you’ll start with Airtable to store your recipes and then maybe a bit of automation to refine the scaling. That way, it’s a bit more foolproof and the portions turn out just right.

You said:
“Okay, so then for the web, you know, I like this idea of kind of having to be able to kind of select recipe cards and, you know, that nice sort of hello fresh selection, and not having to kind of worry about all the different ingredients. There's a piece in there as well, which has been able to kind of say what's in my cupboard. So, you know, if I've still got half a jar of hoisin sauce, for example, it's not adding another one to the list.”
00:33
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, that’s a really smart idea to add a sort of “what’s in my cupboard” feature. It definitely makes the whole experience more efficient and reduces waste, which is exactly what you’re aiming for.

So for your web app, you could have a simple interface where you pick your recipe cards—just like that nice HelloFresh style. And then you have a little section where you can keep track of what you already have at home. Maybe it’s a simple checklist or a pantry inventory that you can update whenever you buy something. Then, when you select your recipes and generate your shopping list, the app can automatically skip adding things you’ve already got.

It’s a really neat way to make it all feel more personalised and sustainable, and it means you’re not ending up with three bottles of the same sauce when you only need one. So that pantry feature would be a great little addition to your MVP.

You said:
“I'm wondering, actually, because there's lots of bloggers, right? And they've got hundreds of recipes, right? So I would be able to use a web scraper to look for the object, which is obviously the ingredient, and then the image, and then tips or whatever.”
00:23
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, you’re spot on. A web scraper can definitely help you pull in those recipes from bloggers who have loads of them online. You could set it up to look for the key elements like the ingredient list, the image, and any tips or instructions they provide. That way, you can start building your own little database of recipes without having to enter everything manually.

And this ties in nicely with what you were saying before: you can have those recipes ready to go, and then just add your own tweaks—like portion control and pantry checks—on top. It’s a great way to get a head start and populate your app with a bunch of recipes that you already love. So yeah, web scraping is a perfect tool to make that part a whole lot easier.

You said:
“Okay, so that's taking care of recipes, so let's just say for now I've got 10 recipes and I can add them and it's just for me, I'm not worried about trying to make money. Now I need to work out how I can create the little web app.”
00:17
ChatGPT said:
Perfect, that sounds like a great next step. So with your 10 recipes in hand and no need to worry about monetisation, you can definitely keep the web app nice and simple.

One easy way to do this, especially if you’re not a coder, is to use a no-code tool like Glide or Softr. These platforms can turn your Airtable (or even a Google Sheet) into a simple web app with just a few clicks. You basically connect your data source, choose a template, and then customise it to show your recipe cards.

You’ll get a nice visual interface where you can browse those recipes, select them, and see the details just like you imagined. And then you can layer on those extra features over time, like your portion control or pantry check, as you get more comfortable.

So it’s really all about starting small and using tools that make it easy. That way, you can have your MVP up and running without needing to dive deep into code.

You said:
“Okay, what was the one that you mentioned? Glide and the other one?”
00:03
ChatGPT said:
Yeah, of course! So I mentioned Glide and also Softr. Both of those are really user-friendly no-code platforms. Glide is great for turning a Google Sheet into a simple app, and Softr works really well with Airtable. Either one can help you quickly create that web app interface without needing coding skills, so you can pick whichever feels more comfortable for you.

You said:
“I have been using N8n as a no-code, low-code. I've been using Claude for my project work to create prototypes. So I guess, do I need to use one of those other tools? Or is there even a much simpler way to get the MVP up?”
00:30
ChatGPT said:
Ah, got it! Since you’re already comfortable with tools like n8n and you’ve been using Claude for prototyping, you might not even need to jump to something else. If you’re familiar with those, you can absolutely use them to build a really simple MVP.

For example, you could use n8n to automate some of the backend processes, like pulling in data from Airtable or even running a little web scraper if you want. And then you could just have a super basic front-end interface. It could even be a very simple webpage that just shows your recipes. And if you’re using Claude to help you think through the prototype, you can definitely keep it as simple as you like.

In other words, you don’t have to switch tools if you’re comfortable with what you’ve got. Just use n8n and Claude to piece together a simple workflow and a minimal interface, and that’ll get your MVP up and running in the simplest way possible.

You said:
“So what I would like is, I mean the recipe part is the least interesting bit, so me selecting my meals, so I'm selecting the image in the name of that meal, so in exactly the same way that HelloFresh shows me, it doesn't explain how to cook it or gives me all the instructions, so that kind of recipe card, if you like, is a meal card and I'm, you know, tapping on those and then I've, you know, got, you know, six meals in my basket sort of style. So that first part is a, you know, as a user experience is meal selection and kind of planning, and then there's the kind of, you know, checkout process, which will be, you know, the adding items that I need to buy from the supermarket, and then I've got this idea that I'll then don't necessarily need to buy absolutely everything, but if I, you know, have that list that's able to then be able to be confirmed, I suppose, you know, either sending that to the supermarket or, you know, I've got a tick list that I can go to the local supermarket and pick up those items. So I think that's fine, I think then if we've got like an air table, kind of a shopping list, I suppose, I'm not too sure how we would keep track of that.”
01:38
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, so let's break that down a little more. It sounds like the core user experience you want is basically a really nice visual meal selection. So imagine that first step is like a gallery of meal cards, where you’re just tapping on the images and names that appeal to you. Each time you pick a meal, it just adds it to your planning list—kind of like building a little weekly menu for yourself. And you don’t have to worry about the details at that stage; it’s all just about choosing what looks good.

Then the next step is the “shopping list” part. So once you’ve got those meals selected, the app can generate a list of ingredients you need. And if you’re using Airtable, that can just be a simple table that shows each ingredient and how much you need. You can have a checkbox or some way to mark what you already have, and then the final list is just the things you actually need to buy.

For the “checkout” or the final step, you can either export that list to your preferred supermarket’s online cart if you want to order online, or just use it as a checklist if you’re shopping in person. That way, the Airtable acts as your flexible shopping list manager, and you can tick things off as you go.

So overall, it’s all about making that meal selection nice and visual, and then letting the shopping list be simple and flexible. You’ve got all the right pieces, and it should come together really nicely.

You said:
“Ok, so then the next bit is what I hate about those recipe cards and the blog is like you have to skip down and there's a whole bunch of fluff about their story and their whatever, it's hard to kind of navigate. So having the items in the same way that, well similar style that HelloFresh does, nice and simple, step one, step two, etc. So not having to kind of move around, everything's kind of in a similar visual format. What's helpful as well is the timings of things, so now do this, now do that, you know, after 10 minutes or whatever. So I think that, you know, kind of click now button or whatever, just a really simple navigation, I can see the steps.”
00:58
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, and I totally get that. Those long blog stories can be a bit of a hassle when all you really want is just the simple steps. So for your app, you can definitely strip all of that fluff away and just have a nice, clean, step-by-step format. Kind of like the HelloFresh card style, where you just have step one, step two, and it’s all very visual and easy to follow.

And adding those timing cues is a great idea. You could have a little “cook now” button or just a simple timer suggestion so you know how long each step should take. That way, it’s not only straightforward but also helps you pace yourself as you cook.

So in the end, you’ll have a really clean, no-nonsense recipe card that’s just focused on the steps and the timing. And that’ll make the whole cooking experience a lot more enjoyable and straightforward for you.

You said:
“Okay, so what I would like to do now is to request a user experience kind of wireframe. Can you help me give you instructions to how I see each of those pages so that you can create a markdown language instructions that I could either get a web developer to do or or their ChatGPT code? So let's make it really simple but detailed.”
00:42
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, let’s do that. I’ll help you outline a wireframe concept in Markdown so you can hand it off easily. We’ll keep it simple but cover each key page.

Wireframe Outline for Meal Planning App
1. Meal Selection Page
Layout: A grid of meal cards, each card showing an image and the meal name underneath.

User Action: Tap a meal card to add it to the selection. Selected meals could have a small indicator (like a checkmark) to show they’re in the basket.

Navigation: A “Next” button at the bottom to proceed to the shopping list.

2. Shopping List Page
Layout: A simple list of ingredients generated from the selected meals. Each item has a checkbox so users can tick off what they already have.

User Action: Check off items, and a “Generate List” button at the bottom to finalize.

Export Option: A button to either copy the list or send it to a supermarket site (optional).

3. Recipe Steps Page
Layout: A clean, step-by-step instruction view. Each step is a card with a brief instruction and an optional timer or duration.

User Action: Tap “Next” to go through each step. You can also have a “Start Cooking” button that begins the first step.

Consistent Style: Keep all steps visually similar to avoid any confusion.

This should give you a simple, clear set of instructions that you can share with a developer or use with Claude or even code it yourself if you want. It’s simple, but it covers all the key details.

You said:
Let's explore ideas of additional features. So, I might have a filter or a sort by, you know, a Quip to Cock inspiration. You know, it might be an Indian or a Malaysian or... I guess it's kind of like, you know, when you're... It should feel like I've got choice or inspiration, something that I'm just not copying the same thing every day. If I've got a thinking feature as well, if I have got a list of ingredients, I might have an intolerance or an allergic to something. I might have a goal, so to eat, you know, one fish meal a week, you know, vegetarian day. And the goal is, you know, to have more of a balanced nutritional... Yeah, at the moment it's just so boring, cooking.
ChatGPT said:
I hear you — the magic is in making cooking feel like inspiration rather than a chore. If the base app covers the “recipe cards + shopping list” flow, then these additional features can really make it more personal, playful, and motivating. Here are some layered ideas:

1. Filters & Sorting for Inspiration
Cuisine Explorer: Quickly sort by Indian, Malaysian, Italian, Mediterranean, etc.

Mood-based Filters: “Quick comfort”, “Light & fresh”, “Something adventurous”.

Occasion Modes: Solo dinner, date night, family feast, or “cook once, eat twice”.

Difficulty Levels: From “lazy but tasty” to “weekend project”.

2. Smart Goal-Based Planning
Nutritional Goals: Build a weekly planner that nudges you toward variety — e.g. “one fish dish”, “one meat-free day”, “limit red meat to once”.

Balanced Rotation: Tracks what you’ve cooked recently and suggests something different to avoid repeats.

Macro Awareness (optional for later): Suggests swaps to hit protein, fibre, or calorie targets without overcomplicating.

3. Allergies & Intolerances
Exclude Ingredients: Permanent filter for things like peanuts, dairy, gluten, or onions if needed.

Ingredient Swaps: Suggests alternatives automatically (e.g. swap cream for coconut milk).

Safe Defaults: Marks recipes as “safe” once filtered so you don’t need to check every time.

4. Ingredient-First Thinking
Fridge Rescue: Input what’s left in your fridge (“half a pepper, some spinach, one chicken breast”), and the app suggests what to make.

Expiry-Aware Suggestions: If you log items, the app nudges you: “Use your spinach today — try this stir fry”.

Smart Pairing: Reuses awkward ingredients across multiple recipes (e.g. coriander, spring onions).

5. Fun & Motivation
Cooking Streaks: Gentle gamification (“3 new meals tried this month”).

Personal Tags: Mark recipes as “cosy”, “surprise hit”, or “never again”.

Mini Challenges: “This week: 1 curry, 1 pasta, 1 veggie bowl”.

Visual Inspiration: Swipeable card deck like Tinder for meals — for those days you can’t decide.

6. Practical Time-Savers
20-Minute Mode: One-tap filter for recipes under 20 mins.

Batch Cook Suggestions: Show which meals reheat well for lunches.

One-Pot / Minimal Washing Up: Filter recipes that save on effort afterwards.

Would you like me to map these into a “feature roadmap” style list — i.e. MVP (must have), nice-to-have (phase 2), inspirational (future dream features)? That way, you can keep the focus tight for version 1 but still capture all the fun ideas.

You’re exploring a few recipe URLs—a gluten-free fish and chips blog post and two BBC recipe pages—and wondering about repurposing their content (like images or steps). Let’s clarify how copyright works and what’s safe (especially in the UK).

What Is Protected Under Copyright?
Ingredient lists alone generally aren’t protected, as they’re seen as mere facts. You’re free to use the ingredient components themselves.

What You Can and Can't Do
What’s Generally OK:
Use the ingredient list or adapt it to your own style.

Cook the recipe yourself and take your own photos—those are yours to use freely.

Reference the recipe with a source link (good ethics, but doesn’t fully bypass copyright if you still use protected material).

What’s Problematic Without Permission:
Copying the exact step-by-step instructions or narrative from the site.

Using the blog’s photos without explicit permission.

Even with attribution, copying protected content can still infringe copyright if permission hasn’t been granted.

Best Practice for Your Project
If you’d like to include content from those URLs in your MVP:

Use ingredient lists only.

Write your own version of the cooking steps in your own words.

Take your own photos or use licensed-free imagery.

Always credit the source (“Recipe adapted from…”, with a link) — it’s courteous and transparent, though not a legal safeguard by itself.

If you’re unsure, ask permission from the content owner—it may be simpler than it seems.

Element	Allowed Without Permission?	Note
Ingredient list	Yes	Licensed as factual information
Instruction wording/story	No	Protected original expression
Blog images	No	Fully protected artistic work

## Future Requirements

- **Advanced Favourites System**:
    - Favourites should be definable per person (Profile) as well as "Global/Everyone".
    - Ability to filter recipes based on specific people's favourites (e.g., "Show me what [Name] likes" for special occasions or when others are away).
